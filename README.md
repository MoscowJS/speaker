## Abstract

## Submission Requirements

### Public Speaking Experience

No previous experience is required to give a talk. Our team will help you
prepare your presentation.

### Required Info

To submit a talk this information is required:

- Name of the talk
- Preferred ways to contact you

### Topics

Here is an **incomplete** list of topics, that we welcome at the meetup.

- Technical topics: programming languages, libraries, frameworks, platforms;
- Processes and communication: team organization, knowledge sharing;
- Non-standart applications of technology: experiments and reasoning;
- Online and offline communities: building and expanding thematic discussion groups.

This list is here only for reference. If you have an idea for a talk, that
does not relate to any of those, please don't hesitate to [submit
it](#submission-process).

## Submission Process

There are currently 2 ways to submit a talk:

- [Official Site][site]
- Email [team@moscowjs.ru][email]

You'll receive an answer from organizers within a week after submission.

## Details about your Talk

Your submission got accepted, congratulations! You can start preparing the
presentation. In the meantime organizers will need additional information
about the talk to share on social media and mailing lists.

Please send all the info to our [email][email].

Please provide this information before given dates. It is important for
us to inform everyone interested in the event at times when it's relevant.

Let's use [NASA countdown][nasa-countdown] scheme to mark important
milestones. Given that `T` is the date of the meetup:

Please send us:

* `T-21 days` (3 weeks before)

    Information about you:

    - Your Name
    - Skype ID (for rehersals)
    - Phone number (as an emergency contact)
    - Photo (for the [web site][site])
    - Public contacts, like twitter, github etc (for the [web site][site])

    Information about the talk:

    - Talk description (for meetup announcement)
    - Main points (for organizers to know what the talk will be about)

* `T-14 days` (2 weeks before)

    2 dates, when it's comfortable for you to do skype calls/rehersals. E.g.

        12 May 19:00-22:00
        15 May 21:00-23:00

    More on rehersals later.

* `T-1 day` (1 day before)

    Your slides, both original and `pdf` versions.

## Preparation Process

We encourage you to be creative with your presentation. But whatever you
want to do "on stage" experience shows that it's better to be prepared.

You'll find links about every aspect of preparing a talk [below](#links).
As well as our [check list for slides](#checklist-for-slides).

One of the ways to improve quality of your presentation is to do
rehersals.  You can do them by yourself, telling your speach out loud, or
ask a collegue to listen to you and give feedback.

Every our talk goes through **3 rehersal sessions** with organizers and
previous speakers. Two of them by skype, one live at the venue the day
before meetup.

You'll receive feedback from people with experience both **doing**
technical presentations and **coaching** people who are preparing one.

This may seem like an overkill, but belive me, your presentation will be
more valuable, clear and concise after these rehersals. You will be less
nervous on stage and prepared in case anything goes wrong. Listeners will
be thankful and you'll have something to be proud of. (Did I mention that
every talk is recoreded and published online after the event?)
