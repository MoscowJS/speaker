## Abstract

This repo contains guidlines on how to submit and prepare a talk for
[MoscowJS][site].


## Submission Requirements

### Public Speaking Experience

No previous public speaking experience is required to give a talk. We
welcome everyone and will help you prepare your speech.

### Required Info

- Name of the talk
- Preferred ways to contact you

### Topics

Here is an **incomplete** list of topics, that we welcome at the meetup.

- Technical topics: programming languages, libraries, frameworks, platforms;
- Processes and communication: team organization, knowledge sharing;
- Non-standart applications of technology: experiments and reasoning;
- Online and offline communities: building and expanding thematic discussion groups.

This list is here only for reference. If you have an idea for a talk, that
does not relate to any of those, please don't hesitate to [submit
it](#submission-process).

### Limitations

The only limitation we have now is timing: presentation should not take
more than 15 minutes + 5 minutes for questions from the audience.

## Submission Process

Submit your proposal by email to [team@moscowjs.ru][email] or this [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GI7rQQpjedSFtOYS5aDYkeYP55F80wNNg2eyFEle4zk/viewform).

Also you can create PR to [MoscowsJS][repo] repository.

How to make PR:

1. Fork [MoscowsJS][repo] repository.
2. Upload photo with you to [speakers photos folder][speakers-photos] and name it with your nikname.
3. Create or use existing moscowjs-\*.md file with other proposals in
   [events folder][events].
4. Write title and description of your talk, attach your upladed photo and your contacts. See [example](https://github.com/MoscowJS/moscowjs.ru/blob/gen-v2/content/events/moscowjs-29.md).
5. Make PR and wait.

## Details about your Talk

Your submission got accepted, congratulations! You can start preparing the
presentation. In the meantime organizers will need additional information
about the talk to share on social media and mailing lists.

Please send all the info to our [email][email].

Please provide this information before given dates. It is important for
us to inform everyone interested in the event when it's relevant.

Let's use [NASA countdown][nasa-countdown] scheme to mark important
milestones. Given that `T` is the date of the meetup:

Please send us:

* `T-21 days` (3 weeks before)

    Information about you:

    - Your Name
    - Company Name (optional)
    - Skype ID (for rehearsals)
    - Phone number (as an emergency contact)
    - Photo (for the [web site][site])
    - Public contacts, like twitter, github etc (for the [web site][site])

    Information about the talk:

    - Talk description (for meetup announcement)
    - Main points (for organizers to know what the talk will be about)

* `T-14 days` (2 weeks before)

    2 dates, when it's comfortable for you to do skype calls/rehearsals. E.g.

        12 May 19:00-22:00
        15 May 21:00-23:00

    More on rehearsals [here](#preparation-process).

* `T-1 day` (1 day before)

    Your slides, both original and `pdf` versions.

## Preparation Process

We encourage you to be creative with your presentation. But whatever you
want to do "on stage" experience shows that it's better to be prepared.

You'll find links about every aspect of preparing a talk [below](#links).
As well as our [check list for slides](#checklist-for-slides).

One of the ways to improve quality of your presentation is to do
rehearsals.  You can do them by yourself, telling your speech out loud, or
ask a collegue to listen to you and give feedback.

Every our talk goes through **3 rehearsal sessions** with organizers and
previous speakers. Two of them by skype, one live at the venue the day
before meetup.

You'll receive feedback from people with experience both **doing**
technical presentations and **coaching** people who are preparing one.

This may seem like an overkill, but believe me, your presentation will be
more valuable, clear and concise after these rehearsals. You will be less
nervous on stage and prepared in case anything goes wrong. Listeners will
be thankful and you'll have something to be proud of. (Did I mention that
every talk is recoreded and published online after the event?)

## Checklist for slides

Please make sure your slides comply these requirements:

- [ ] Title slide
  - [ ] Has the name of the talk

## After the Talk

We want you to get the most out of your experience speaking at MoscowJS.
This section is about what happens after the meetup and how it can help
you improve yourself as a speaker and keep in touch with other speakers
and organizers.

### Feedback

Feedback is an important step of the process. It can help you uderstand
your strengths and weaknesses, choose a direction in which you'd like to
grow as a speaker.

We usually ask attendees to rate the meetup and every talk after the
event. You as a speaker will have access to this feedback.

Another great source of feedback are your mentors. If you had rehearsals
before the meetup, feel free to reach out to your mentors and ask for
their general opinion about how you did.


### Next Steps

I hope you've enjoyed working on your presentation and speaking at
MoscowJS. If you have, and would like to contribute in return, this is how
you can help us make MoscowJS better.

* Take one speaker of the future meetup and help them prepare their
  presentation. Join their rehearsals and share what you've learned. This
  is also a good way to learn more about the speaker's subject and public
  speaking in general.

* Participate in discussions in the Speakers Mailing List. Share your
  thoughts on how to improve MoscowJS.

* Enjoy going to our events without registering in advance. From that
  moment on you will always be on the list ;)
